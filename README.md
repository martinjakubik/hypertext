# learnhypertext

learnhypertext lets you make and move HTML documents with a focus on readability of the code rather than performance or indeed usability

priorities of learnhypertext code:
1) it works, and you can use it to make web pages (HTML documents)
2) it is easy to read and can be used for teaching
3) it is easy to use (note that this is lower priority)
4) it is optimized for performance (very low priority)

As such, learnhypertext differs from libraries like React or Angular in that it is not meant to be used in production-level applications.

Instead, it is suitable for people learning how to use JavaScript for the first time to make web pages.
